## Analysis of alogorithms - 
1. When we calculate the complexity, we consider only higher end of number of input. Even though at small number of inputs, g(n) gives better performance.

Following is the comparision for higher value of n 
( here we ignore the lower order of terms and leading constants)

```
constant << log log n << log n << n ^ 1/3 << n ^ 1/2  << n << n ^ 2 << n ^ 3 << 2 ^ n << n ^ n
```

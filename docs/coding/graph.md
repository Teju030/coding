## Graph terminology

V - number of vertices
E - set of edges

- `Walk (path)` - nodes visited to reach from src to dest ( repeatation of edages is allowed)
- `Path (Simple path)` - repeatation of edges is not allowed
- `acyclic`
- weighted graphs and unweighted graphs 

### Undirected graph

Sample graph

1 ----- 2 ----- 5
|       |
|       |
3 ----- 4 

- Degree - Number of edges present at given node
- sum of degrees =  2 * |E|
- max number of edges =    [ |V| *(|V|-1) ] / 2

        
### Directed Graph

Indegree - number of incomming edges
Outdegree - number of outgoing edges
